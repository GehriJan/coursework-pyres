  abstract  = {E 2.3 is a theorem prover for many-sorted first-order logic with equality. We describe the basic logical and software architecture of the system, as well as core features of the implementation. We particularly discuss recently added features and extensions, including the extension to many-sorted logic, optional limited support for higher-order logic, and the integration of SAT techniques via PicoSAT. Minor additions include improved support for TPTP standard features, always-on internal proof objects, and lazy orphan removal. The paper also gives an overview of the performance of the system, and describes ongoing and future work.},

This system description provides an overview of our recent developments in SPASS 3.5 including subterm contextual rewriting, improved split backtracking, a significantly faster FLOTTER implementation with additional control flags, completely symmetric implementation of forward and backward redundancy criteria, faster parsing with improved support for big files, faster and extended sort module, and support for include commands in input files. Finally, SPASS 3.5 can now parse files in TPTP syntax, comes with a new converter tptp2dfg and is distributed under a BSD style license.",
