  This chapter discusses the formulas that are certain finite strings of symbols. The “first” in the phrase “first-order logic” is to distinguish this form of logic from stronger logics, such as second-order or weak second-order logic, where certain extralogical notions (set or natural number) are taken as given in advance. The chapter provides information of what can and what cannot be expressed in first-order logic. Most of the examples are taken from the wealth of notions in modern algebra with which most mathematicians have at least a nodding acquaintance. The chapter also discusses many-sorted first-order logic, ω-logic, weak second-order logic, Infinitary logic, Logic with new quantifiers, and abstract model theory.}

  abstract="PyRes is a complete theorem prover for classical first-order logic. It is not designed for high performance, but to clearly demonstrate the core concepts of a saturating theorem prover. The system is written in extensively commented Python, explaining data structures, algorithms, and many of the underlying theoretical concepts. The prover implements binary resolution with factoring and optional negative literal selection. Equality is handled by adding the basic axioms of equality. PyRes uses the given-clause algorithm, optionally controlled by weight- and age evaluations for clause selection. The prover can read TPTP CNF/FOF input files and produces TPTP/TSTP proof objects.",
